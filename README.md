# IFC4.docset-for zeal

I used a tool htmal2dash.py to convert the HTML version of IFC4 documentation to .docset file.

DOCSET is a developer file created by Doxygen, a source code documentation system. It contains 
an archive of documentation about a body of source code, which can encompass many different 
individual source code files and code constructs; used as the storage format for publishing 
documentation to developers that use the source code.

By using appropriate application like Zeal, the Windows and Linux offline documentation browser, 
or Dash for ios, you can import IFC.docset to them and then just navigate and check some entities
or class on your machine offline.
